See a complete list from my [citeulike zb tag](http://www.citeulike.org/user/gerbaudo/tag/zb).
Here is just a short list of the most important papers with summaries.

- [Beautiful Mirrors and Precision Electroweak Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0109097)
The original 'beautiful mirror' paper by Tim et al.  It provides a
motivation for introducing additional bottom-like quark from the
electroweak fit (see in particular Fig.1).

- [Higgs Couplings and Precision Electroweak Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6382)
A follow up by Gori et al. in light of the Higgs boson discovery. They
propose a "a modified `Beautiful Mirrors' scenario which contains new
vector-like quarks". They fit to the existing data the parameters that
modify the lagrangian (in particular the Zbb couplings). Note to self:
they predict an enhanced h-gam-gam coupling, which seems to be the
case for the current measurements from ATLAS and CMS

Cannot get Z b to work.
Need to add b, b~ to p and j within multiparticles_default.txt
